# Illustrator Scripts

Here are all my scripts for Adobe Illustrator.

## How to use a script ?

* Download the .js code of the script :
    * Left click on the .js file.
    * Click on the raw button.
    * Right click anywhere and save it to `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [version]\Presets\[lang_LANG]\Scripts\`.
* Re open Illustrator, make a selection of shapes (not grouped) and go to `file > script > aléatoiriseur`. A dialog will pop up allowing you to interact with the script.

------------------

## Aléatoiriseur
