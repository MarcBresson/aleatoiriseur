# Illustrator Scripts

Here are all my scripts for Adobe Illustrator.

## How to use a script ?

* Download the raw code of the script, and save it to `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2021\Presets\[lang_LANG]\Scripts\`
* Re open Illustrator, make a selection of shapes (not grouped) and go to `file > script > aléatoiriseur`. A dialog will pop up allowing you to interact with the script.
