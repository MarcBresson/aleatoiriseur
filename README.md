# Aleatoiriseur

A plugin that randomize things for Adobe Illustrator 

------------------

## How to use it ?

* Download the raw code of the script, and save it to `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2021\Presets\[lang_LANG]\Scripts\`
* Re open Illustrator, make a selection of shapes (not grouped) and go to `file > script > aleatoiriseur`. A dialog will pop up allowing you to interact with the script.

## To Do

* Convert it to a panel instead of a popup.
* Keep the swatch selected when using a random color in a swatch.
* Make it able to explore groups.
* Make the cancel button a cancel button (not just a close-window button)

Fell free to contribute to this project ! I'll keep things updated on the main branch.

## V1.1
* Better UI
* Random Selection fixed
* Function simplification
* Translated everything to english
* Cancel Button closes the dialog
